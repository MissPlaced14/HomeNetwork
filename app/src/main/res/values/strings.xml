    <string name="welcome"> This application is looking to the modernize wifi authenticatiopn while keeping the average
     tect-illetrate user able to manage and understand their home internet. As it stands today, a single wifi password
    is used to connect every device to the network. If an "intruder" were to obtain your password, the only way
    to kick them off would be to change the wifi password and then re-enter said password on every device in the home.
    Beyond this, it is difficult for the average user(WIFI ADMINISTRATOR) to know if there is any unwanted device on the network
    due to the unfriendliness of the current interfaces. </string>
